# android-poc

This app shows the Printess Buyer Side editor in the Panel UI utilising a WebView. 
A way to display the old Printess UI is also shown, but commented out.
This example uses the ```/buyer-test-android.html``` endpoint to connect to Printess.

## How to run

Opening this project in Android Studio and building and running it should work out of the box.
Note, that WebViews do not work with Previews currently, so you need to run this on a device, emulated or physical.
